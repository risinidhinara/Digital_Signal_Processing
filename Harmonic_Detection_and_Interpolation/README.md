1 Introduction and General Guidelines
This programming assignment is concerned with two important applications of the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT), namely, detecting sinusoidal signals from noisy discrete-time signal
and interpolating a discrete-time signal using the DFT.
Section 2 contains a general overview of the theory used in this assignment, followed by
Section 3 and Section 4, which contains the specific tasks for the assignment.
Submit a report containing your solutions, diagrams, and explanations for each
task. Briefly explain/justify how you obtained each of your answers. This will help
us determine your understanding of the problem whether or not you got the correct answer.
Moreover, in the event of an incorrect answer, we can still try to give you partial credit based
on the explanation you provide. You may append your MATLAB codes as an appendix of this
report.
